I am a research student at the [Data Science and Mining Team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), advised by Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). Previously, I graduated from Ecole CentraleSupélec at the [University of Paris-Saclay], with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. I also graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, from the MVA (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage) master's. During my studies, I worked at [Amadeus IT Group] as a machine learning intern, working on forecasting models for reservations that are adapted for COVID-19 period. 

My research interests are <strong>Natural Language Processing(NLP)</strong> and <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong> applied to Health, Biology and Chemistry. Currently, I am working on improving antibiotic resistance detection using the structure of proteins as a complement to their sequence. I am also working on developping richer embeddings for molecules, through pre-training of Graph Neural Networks using large available datasets.
