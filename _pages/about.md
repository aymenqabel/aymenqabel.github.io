I am a Research Engineer at the Computer Science Laboratory's [Data Science and Mining Team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), under the guidance of Professor [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). I recently obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning (MVA) from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) ([University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)) and previously earned a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from École CentraleSupélec ([University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)) in 2021.

With a focus on machine learning, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects and internships. I completed a six-month internship at [Amadeus IT Group](https://amadeus.com/en) in Nice as a machine learning researcher, where I developed time-series forecasting models specifically adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also had the chance to work as a research intern at [Institut Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/), where I researched Transformer-based models for cancer prognosis.

My research interests are diverse and encompass<strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Graph mining</strong> and <strong>Multi Modality Learning</strong>. Through my previous projects and publications, I have sought to expand my skill set in these areas as much as possible. Currently, I am working on improving the representation of molecules and proteins by pre-training Graph Neural Networks using large available datasets.
