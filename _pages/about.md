 I am a Research Intern at the [Data Science and Mining Team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), advised by Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). I recently graduated from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) ([University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)), completing a Master's degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning (MVA). Prior to that, in 2021, I graduated from École [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) ([University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/)) with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.

During the last few years, I have worked on different machine learning projects. I have completed a 6-month internship at [Amadeus IT Group](https://amadeus.com/en), Nice, working as a machine learning researcher on developing time-series forecasting models adapted to the COVID-19 period. I have also done a research internship at [Institut Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/), working on developing Transformer-based models for cancer prognosis upon consultation. 

My research interests span the broad areas of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Graph mining</strong> and <strong>Multi Modality Learning</strong>. In my recent publications, and my previous projects, I tried to cover these areas as much as possible to have a wide variety of skills. Currently, I am working on improving antibiotic resistance detection using the structure of proteins as a complement to their sequence. I am also working on developping richer embeddings for molecules, through pre-training of Graph Neural Networks using large available datasets.
